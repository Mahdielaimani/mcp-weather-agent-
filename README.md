#  Weather Application with MCP

A comprehensive weather application for Moroccan cities using the Model Context Protocol (MCP) architecture. This project demonstrates how to build a client-server application that leverages the MCP protocol to provide weather information through a standardized interface.



## Features

- **Real-time Weather Data**: Get current weather conditions for Moroccan cities
- **City Listing**: Browse available Moroccan cities
- **Interactive CLI**: User-friendly command-line interface
- **Secure API Key Management**: Environment-based API key storage
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and user feedback
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easy to add new tools and capabilities

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Internet connection for API access
- OpenWeatherMap API key (free tier available)
- Basic knowledge of command-line interfaces


### What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized protocol for communication between AI models and external tools or services. It enables:

- **Standardized Communication**: Consistent interface for models to interact with external tools
- **Tool Discovery**: Dynamic discovery of available tools and their capabilities
- **Structured Data Exchange**: Well-defined JSON-RPC based communication format
- **Extensibility**: Easy addition of new tools without changing the client implementati
